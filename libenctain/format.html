  <h1>CryptoTE / Enctain File Format v1.0</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This HTML document describes the file format used by <a href="http://idlebox.net/2008/cryptote/">CryptoTE</a>. The editor saves text documents in an encrypted container file using the libenctain library. Enctain is short for ENCrypted conTAINer. An encrypted container can hold a set of enumerated binary subfiles with associated application-defined metadata.</p>

  <h2>Format Overview</h2>

  <p>Each encrypted container file consists of the following sections:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>

      <td class="f c">Unencrypted Header1</td>

      <td>Fixed-length header data. Contains a magic signature to identify file format and version. Implicitly specifies the metadata encryption cipher and method.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>2</td>

      <td class="f c">Unencrypted Metadata</td>

      <td>Variable-length key-value properties. They are application-defined and publicly readable. Thus they can be displayed e.g. in file listings without requiring the encryption key.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>3</td>

      <td class="f c">Encrypted Master KeySlots</td>

      <td>Encryption context parameters: contains a master key which is encrypted using different user password-keys. Any valid user password can be used to open the container. Lots of parameters are needed to make the encryption key derivation secure.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>4</td>

      <td class="f c">Encrypted Header3</td>

      <td>Fixed-length header containing metadata length and CRC32 checksum.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>5</td>

      <td class="f c">Encrypted Compressed Metadata</td>

      <td>Variable-length key-value properties. Contains two distinct parts: global metadata properties and (local) SubFile metadata properties. Both global and SubFile-local allow any number of application-defined properties. Besides the application-defined properties, the metadata also contains some fixed properties: the SubFile's compressed and uncompressed size, encryption and compression methods, CRC32 checksum and possibly encryption key and initialization vector.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>6</td>

      <td class="f c">SubFile Data</td>

      <td>SubFile binary data, possibly encrypted and compressed. No separators are needed anymore.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Detailed Format v1.0</h2>

  <p>All binary numbers are stored in little-endian encoding. uint is an abbreviation for unsigned integer.</p>

  <h3>Unencrypted Header1</h3>

  <p>Header1 is an unencrypted fixed-length header at offset 0 to identify the file format and version.</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>

      <td class="f">8 bytes</td>

      <td class="f c">Signature</td>

      <td>An eight byte string or binary magic signature to identify the file's type. The CryptoTE editor uses "CryptoTE" (without NULL string termination). The value used by Enctain can be changed using the function <code>SetSignature()</code>.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>2</td>

      <td class="f">16 bit uint</td>

      <td class="f c">Version Major</td>

      <td rowspan="2">Currently (major = 1, minor = 0) which means v1.0. This version number also implicitly defines the following sections including encryption cipher and compression methods.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>3</td>

      <td class="f">16 bit uint</td>

      <td class="f c">Version Minor</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>4</td>

      <td class="f">32 bit uint</td>

      <td class="f c">Unencrypted Metadata Length</td>

      <td>Length of the following unencrypted metadata in bytes.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>

      <td colspan="2">16 bytes Total</td>

      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Unencrypted Metadata</h3>

  <p>The first variable-length section of the file contains application-defined unencrypted metadata properties. These key-value pairs can be set, retrieved and enumerated using the functions <code>Set&shy;Global&shy;Unencrypted&shy;Property()</code>, <code>Set&shy;Global&shy;Unencrypted&shy;Property()</code>, <code>Erase&shy;Global&shy;Unencrypted&shy;Property()</code> and <code>Erase&shy;Global&shy;Unencrypted&shy;Property()</code>. This section can also be omitted (Header1.MetadataLength == 0), if no properties are defined by the application.</p>

  <p>Application-defined metadata properties are key-value pairs of opaque binary strings. Enctain will store any data values (including NULLs) and any amount (&lt; 4GB in total). This way data like current window position and other dialog settings can be stored using some private binary structure.</p>

  <p>These key-value lists are stored by Enctain using the following format. Each properties key-value consists of two (possibly binary) strings, the key and the value. The (binary) string data is prefixed with it's length encoded in a single byte:</p>

  <p>Example:<br />
  The value "string" is encoded into the hexbytes <code>06 73 74 72 69 6e 67</code>. Note the <code>06</code> string length at the beginning.</p>

  <p>This encoding makes the functions to read and write variable-length strings very simple. Furthermore binary NULL (0 bytes) can also be stored in the strings, as they are not NULL-terminated.</p>

  <p>If a string is longer than 255 bytes the length does not fit into the prefix byte. Therefore an "escape length" is introduced: <code>0xFF</code> in the length field means "long string". The <code>0xFF</code> is then followed by a 32-bit unsigned integer specifying the full length of the string. Therefore all strings with 255 bytes or longer have 5 prefix bytes specifying their length.</p>

  <p>Example:<br />
  A string containing 'a' 1022 times is encoded: <code>FF FE 03 00 00 61 61 <em>(1018(decimal) more 61s)</em> 61 61</code>.</p>

  <p>The variable-length unencrypted metadata section contains a list of concatenated key-value pairs, which represent the global properties of the container. The number of key-value pairs (!) is stored as a 32-bit uint as the beginning of the variable length structure. The total length of this section is defined by Header1.UnencryptedMetadataLength. The actual key-value pairs used are completely left up to the application.</p>

  <p>CryptoTE currently uses the following unencrypted key-value properties:</p>

  <table class="ff">
    <tr>
      <td>Subject</td>

      <td>User-defined&nbsp;subject text string from the container properties dialog.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Author</td>

      <td>User-defined author text string from the container properties dialog. Initialized with the user's login name for new containers.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>

      <td>User-defined description multi-line string from the container properties dialog.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Encrypted KeySlots Header2</h3>

  <p>The KeySlots header section contains all information needed to decrypt and validate the master key material when a valid user secret password is provided. Ultimately the master key is used to decrypt the following two encrypted header sections. This section is the Achilles' heel of the file's encryption security.</p>

  <p>The container format supports multiple user password slots. Each slot can be used to decrypt the file. As the user password data is hashed (repeatedly), the original passwords cannot be reconstructed from the information in the container. They are also not stored.</p>

  <p>For password hashing Enctain currently uses the <code>PBKDF2</code> (Password-Based Key Derivation Function) from PKCS#5 v2 [<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt">RFC2898</a>] with <code>HMAC(SHA256)</code> as hash function. All three algorithms are implemented by the mini-Botan library contained in Enctain.</p>

  <p><code>PBKDF2</code> requires an arbitrary amount of random salt data and an iteration count. Random salt data in libenctain is always 32 bytes long and stored in the file. Iteration count is also stored and randomized in the range 1000 - 11000.</p>

  <p>The "master key" material is 64 bytes of random data. It is generated by mini-Botan's random number generator modules. The master key material is generated when the first user key slot is added to the container.</p>

  <p>Three <code>PBKDF2</code>-derivations of the master key material are calculated by Enctain. For all derivations the salt data and iterations count is stored in the header. The first derivation is 32 bytes of digest data which is stored in the container and used by Enctain to detect that the entered user password is correct. The second and third derivation is not stored: they initialize the encryption cipher of the following metadata section. The second derivation is 32 bytes long and is used as encryption key for the Serpent cipher; the third derivation, only 16 bytes long, is used as CBC-IV (Initialization Vector).</p>

This key is used to initialize the Serpent cipher (256 bits) which is then used to decrypt the following encrypted copy of the master key (in ECB mode). After decryption the possibly-correct master key can be verified using the <code>PBKDF2</code> Digest Iterations, Salt and Values (field 2,3 and 4).</td>

  <h3>Encrypted Header3</h3>

  <p>Following the KeySlots is the first encrypted header. This header is 16-bytes long, exactly the block-size of the Serpent cipher which is used to encrypt it. Thus to read this block, the user must be queried for the encryption key, the Serpent cipher must be initialized with CBC-mode filter and the correct initialization vector set. The encryption key (256 bits) and CBC-IV are derived from the master key as described in the previous section.</p>

  <h3>Encrypted Metadata</h3>

  <p>Following the encrypted header is a variable-length block of properties. The length of this section is defined in Header3. This section is encrypted using the Serpent cipher and compressed using zlib. The CBC-IV context continues from the the header. The compressed metadata stream is padded to the block length of the cipher; this is no problem because zlib ignores all data beyond the compressed image's end.</p>

  <p>The compressed metadata contains two main parts: global metadata properties and (local) subfile metadata properties. These are combined into one section to make compression more efficient. Furthermore SubFile metadata is detached from the file data itself so that it is possible to read and display the metadata properties of all subfiles without reading the complete subfile data.</p>

  <p>Special about this section is that fixed and variable data is mixed.</p>

  <h3>SubFile Data</h3>

  <p>Finally after all headers and metadata the actual SubFile data is appended. Each SubFile's storage length, encryption cipher and compression algorithm are defined in the compressed and encrypted metadata section. Thus no additional structuring is required. All SubFiles are simply stored concatenated.</p>

  <p>To locate a specific SubFile's data it is necessary to know the beginning offset of all SubFile Data. To this offset all preceding SubFile's StorageSize field must be added.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p>The following table contains a hexadecimal dump of the beginning of an encrypted container file. The different header fields are color coded for better distinction in the explanation below:</p>

  <p>After the unencrypted metadata the KeySlots header2 begins. The master key digest <span style="color: #FF9900">PBKDF2 iterations count is 1196</span> followed by <span style="color: #FF6622">32 bytes of random salt</span> and another <span style="color: #FFBB22">32 bytes which are the value of the digest</span>. After the digest the PBKDF2 parameters for <span style="color: #9933FF">Serpent key</span> and <span style="color: #C233FF">CBC-IV</span> are stored: 4 bytes iteration and 32 bytes salt. Iterations count for the key are 3721 and for the CBC-IV 5827.</p>

  <p>Last block in the keyslots header holds <span style="color: #70B60D">1 user key slot</span>: it contains an <span style="color: #16926D">iteration count of 334</span>, <span style="color: #168E92">32 bytes of random salt</span> and the <span style="color: #166392">encrypted master key copy</span>.</p>

  <p>Now the encrypted part begins. Here the data is not random salt and keys, but actual data though unreadable. The first 16 bytes are the <span style="color: #F03989">encrypted header3</span> followed by <span style="color: #F0393C">encrypted and compressed metadata</span>. The example dump stops here, because all following data is encrypted and thus incomprehensible.</p>
